    <h1># welcome</h1>
    <p>The Screaming Monkeys Web Guild was created by two Fort Wayne, Indiana web professionals, <a href="http://www.focusminded.com/" target="_blank">James Mitchell</a> and <a href="http://www.timnovinger.com" target="_blank">Tim Novinger</a>. We hold regular events where like-minded web professionals can meet up to...</p>
    <ul>
    <li>=&gt; &nbsp; &nbsp;Talk shop</li>
    <li>=&gt; &nbsp; &nbsp;Discover new technologies </li>
    <li>=&gt; &nbsp; &nbsp;Share ideas</li>
    <li>=&gt; &nbsp; &nbsp;Make connections with peers</li>
    <li>=&gt; &nbsp; &nbsp;Learn, learn, learn...</li>
    </ul>
    <p>...all in a fun, exciting and creative atmosphere.</p>
    <p>As web geeks working in Fort Wayne we noticed a significant amount of local talent, yet a serious lack of organization amongst them. While some amazing groups already exist, they tend to be focused primarily on the creative and print side of the business, and have (in general) nothing to do with the web.</p>
    <p>We intend to fill this gap.</p>
    <p>Our goal is to create a focused group that not only enhances existing working relationships and knowledge by hosting presentations and group talks, but one that bridges the gap between our industry and local education by involving current students.</p>
    <p>Right now, our city is focused on graduate retention and economic growth. What better way to help than by getting students involved in their local industry before they graduate, and to help local professionals network and continue to learn?</p>
